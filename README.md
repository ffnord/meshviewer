# Dependencies

- npm
- bower
- grunt-cli
- Sass (>= 3.2)

# Installing dependencies

Install npm and Sass with your package-manager. On Debian-like systems run:

    sudo apt-get install npm ruby-sass

or if you have bundler you can install ruby-sass simply via `bundle install`

Execute these commands on your server as a normal user to prepare the dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/tcatm/meshviewer.git
    cd meshviewer
    npm install
    npm install grunt-cli

# Building

Just run the following command from the meshviewer directory:

    node_modules/.bin/grunt

This will generate `build/` containing all required files.

# Configure

Copy `config.json.example` to `build/config.json` and change it to match your community.

## dataPath (string)

`dataPath` must point to a directory containing `nodes.json` and `graph.json`
(both are generated by
[ffmap-backend](https://github.com/ffnord/ffmap-backend)). Don't forget the
trailing slash! Data may be served from a different domain with [CORS enabled].
Also, GZip will greatly reduce bandwidth consumption.

## siteName (string)

Change this to match your communities' name. It will be used in various places.

## mapSigmaScale (float)

This affects the initial scale of the map. Greater values will show a larger
area. Values like 1.0 and 0.5 might be good choices.

## mapLatOffset and mapLngOffset (float)

Normally the center of your map is calculated by the geo coordinates of your nodes. If you want to center the map slightly different, you can use mapLatOffset and mapLngOffset. A value of 0 will center the map as normal. Value can be negativ.

## showContact (bool)

Setting this to `false` will hide contact information for nodes.

## maxAge (integer)

Nodes being online for less than maxAge days are considered "new". Likewise,
nodes being offline for less than than maxAge days are considered "lost".

## mapLayers (List)

A list of objects describing map layers. Each object has at least `name`
property and optionally `url` and `config` properties. If no `url` is supplied
`name` is assumed to name a
[Leaflet-provider](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).

## nodeInfos (array, optional)

This option allows to show client statistics depending on following case-sensitive parameters:

- `name` caption of statistics segment in infobox
- `href` absolute or relative URL to statistics image
- `thumbnail` absolute or relative URL to thumbnail image,
  can be the same like `href`
- `caption` is shown, if `thumbnail` is not present (no thumbnail in infobox)

To insert current node-id in either `href`, `thumbnail` or `caption`
you can use the case-sensitive template string `{NODE_ID}`.

Examples for `nodeInfos`:

    "nodeInfos": [
      { "name": "Clientstatistik",
        "href": "nodes/{NODE_ID}.png",
        "thumbnail": "nodes/{NODE_ID}.png",
        "caption": "Knoten {NODE_ID}"
      },
      { "name": "Uptime",
        "href": "nodes_uptime/{NODE_ID}.png",
        "thumbnail": "nodes_uptime/{NODE_ID}.png",
        "caption": "Knoten {NODE_ID}"
      }
    ]

In order to have statistics images available, you have to run the backend with parameter `--with-rrd` or generate them in other ways.

## globalInfos (array, optional)

This option allows to show global statistics on statistics page depending on following case-sensitive parameters:

- `name` caption of statistics segment in infobox
- `href` absolute or relative URL to statistics image
- `thumbnail` absolute or relative URL to thumbnail image,
  can be the same like `href`
- `caption` is shown, if `thumbnail` is not present (no thumbnail in infobox)

In contrast to `nodeInfos` there is no template substitution in  `href`, `thumbnail` or `caption`.

Examples for `globalInfos`:

    "globalInfos": [
      { "name": "Wochenstatistik",
        "href": "nodes/globalGraph.png",
        "thumbnail": "nodes/globalGraph.png",
        "caption": "Bild mit Wochenstatistik"
      },
      { "name": "Jahresstatistik",
        "href": "nodes/globalGraph52.png",
        "thumbnail": "nodes/globalGraph52.png",
        "caption": "Bild mit Jahresstatistik"
      }
    ]

In order to have global statistics available, you have to run the backend with parameter `--with-rrd` (this only creates globalGraph.png) or generate them in other ways.
